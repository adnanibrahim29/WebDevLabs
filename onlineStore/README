I am using an XAMPP server

I have included the localhost password and Maynooth server login

When downloaded you may have to put the downladed folder into XAMPP directory 
and inside the HTDOCS folder (where your XAMPP directory is located)
put all the code files into the HTDOCS folder

Then you can run the code by typing localhost/assignment-04-22325166/assignment-04.php into your browser

if the link doesnt work localhost:8080/assignment-04-22325166/assignment-04.php should work
